Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description

This challenge I created back end for an  E-commerce app using Express API and using the Sequelize ORM library to interact with a My MySQL database.

## User Story

As a manager of an internet retail company
I want a back end of my internet website that uses latest technologies
So that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a functional Express.js API
I can add my database name, MYSQL username, and MySQL password to an enviroment variable file
I am able to connect to database using Sequelize
When I enter schema and seed commands
Then a  development database is created and seeded with test data
When I enter the command to invoke the application
Then my server is started and theSequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
When I open API GET routes in Insomia Core for categories, products, or tags
Then the data for each of this routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomia core
I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
